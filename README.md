# Structural Dynamics

Effect of mutation on protein-ligand binding can be studied by using geometric and physico-chemical descriptors at the binding site. Offsite mutations can affect protein-ligand interactions via dynamic regulation. Molecular simulations are a tool used to understand fluctuations at binding site.  
This code base is for performing grid-based feature computation for a class of protein-ligand interaction sites. Spatio-temporal feature prediction from coarse-grained statistical models are provided.
